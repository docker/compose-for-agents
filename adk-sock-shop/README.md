# üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

+ **[Docker Desktop] 4.43.0+ or [Docker Engine]** installed.
+ **A laptop or workstation with a GPU** (e.g., a MacBook) for running open models locally. If you
  don't have a GPU, you can alternatively use **[Docker Offload]**.
+ If you're using [Docker Engine] on Linux or [Docker Desktop] on Windows, ensure that the
  [Docker Model Runner requirements] are met (specifically that GPU
  support is enabled) and the necessary drivers are installed.
+ If you're using Docker Engine on Linux, ensure you have [Docker Compose] 2.38.1 or later installed.

### Run the project

Some of the MCP servers used here require Secrets. Set the Brave and Reset api keys and then set the secrets for the gateway.

```sh
export BRAVE_API_KEY=<your_brave_api_key>
export RESEND_API_KEY=<resend_api_key>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>
make gateway-secrets
```

If you're running with an arm64 macos machine, then initialize the environment with one additional command:

```sh
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker pull roberthouse224/catalogue
```

To start up the Sock Store and the Agent portal, run:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

+ Open [*http://localhost:9090*](http://localhost:9090) to see the sock store.
+ Open [*http://localhost:3000*](http://localhost:3000) to see the Sock Vendor Agent Portal.

# ‚ùì What Can It Do?

Example input to the portal:

> ‚ÄúI am a sock vendor named Nike. Perhaps you've heard of us. We provide colorful compressions socks,
> that are elegant and affordable.  Our Nike compression socks are 12.99 each.  
> Here are some urls to images of the socks <https://tinyurl.com/5n6spnvu> and
> <https://tinyurl.com/mv8ebjnh>"

# ü§ù Agent Roles

| **Agent**   | **Tools Used**        | **Role Description**                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supplier Intake**  |  None                | Resesarches a new sock vendor and decides whether to onboard them to the store |
| **Reddit Research**  |  BraveSearch via MCP | Searches for reviews on the vendor                             |
| **Customer Review**  |  MongoDB via MCP     | Match styles against historical buyer data to see if it's a match for the store |
| **Catalog**          |  curl via MCP        | Adds the product sku to the catalog if we like the product |
