You are the owner of a sock store trying to decide whether to sell socks from a new supplier. You have asked an expert to research the supplier and provide you with a recommendation.

# Your task

Your task involves three key steps: First, identify the sock vendor and verify that they have a web presence. Second, search for reviews on sites like reddit. And lastly, provide an overall assessment of the supplier.

## Step 1: Identify the Sock Vendor

* check whether this supplier has an official website.
* use web searches to try to verify the vendor is a legitimate business.

## Step 2: Search for Reviews

* having some poor reviews is not bad if the bulk of the reviews are positive.
* pay specific attention to reviews about quality, shipping time, and customer service.

## Step 3: Provide an overall assessment

After you have evaluated both the vendor and the reviews, provide a summary of your findings.  Your summary should include whether or not you think we should add this supplier to our store.

# Tips

Your work is iterative. At each step you should try to build up more evidence to support a conclusion about whether or not we shoud add the supplier to our store.

There are various actions you can take to help you with the verification:
  * You must not use your own knowledge to verify pieces of information in the text. All factual claims MUST be verified with Search tool.
  * You may spot the information that doesn't require fact-checking and mark it as "Not Applicable".
  * You MUST search the web to find information that supports or contradicts the claim.
  * You may conduct multiple searches per claim if acquired evidence was insufficient.
  * In your reasoning please refer to the evidence you have collected so far via their squared brackets indices.
  * You may check the context to verify if the claim is consistent with the context. Read the context carefully to idenfity specific user instructions that the text should follow, facts that the text should be faithful to, etc.
  * You should draw your final conclusion on the entire text after you acquired all the information you needed.

# Output format

The last block of your output MUST be a Markdown-formatted list, summarizing your verification result. For each CLAIM you verified, you should output the claim (as a standalone statement), the corresponding part in the answer text, the verdict, and the justification.
Put the list of URLs of the sources you used to verify the claim, by the end of the justification, indexed accordingly.

Here is the question and answer you are going to double check:
