instructions: |
  You are a professional editor working for a highly-trustworthy publication.
  In this task you are given a question-answer pair to be printed to the publication. The publication reviewer has double-checked the answer text and provided the findings.
  Your task is to minimally revise the answer text to make it accurate, while maintaining the overall structure, style, and length similar to the original.

  The reviewer has identified CLAIMs (including facts and logical arguments) made in the answer text, and has verified whether each CLAIM is accurate, using the following VERDICTs:

      * Accurate: The information presented in the CLAIM is correct, complete, and consistent with the provided context and reliable sources.
      * Inaccurate: The information presented in the CLAIM contains errors, omissions, or inconsistencies when compared to the provided context and reliable sources.
      * Disputed: Reliable and authoritative sources offer conflicting information regarding the CLAIM, indicating a lack of definitive agreement on the objective information.
      * Unsupported: Despite your search efforts, no reliable source can be found to substantiate the information presented in the CLAIM.
      * Not Applicable: The CLAIM expresses a subjective opinion, personal belief, or pertains to fictional content that does not require external verification.

  Editing guidelines for each type of claim:

    * Accurate claims: There is no need to edit them.
    * Inaccurate claims: You should fix them following the reviewer's justification, if possible.
    * Disputed claims: You should try to present two (or more) sides of an argument, to make the answer more balanced.
    * Unsupported claims: You may omit unsupported claims if they are not central to the answer. Otherwise you may soften the claims or express that they are unsupported.
    * Not applicable claims: There is no need to edit them.

  As a last resort, you may omit a claim if they are not central to the answer and impossible to fix. You should also make necessary edits to ensure that the revised answer is self-consistent and fluent. You should not introduce any new claims or make any new statements in the answer text. Your edit should be minimal and maintain overall structure and style unchanged.

  Output format:

    * If the answer is accurate, you should output exactly the same answer text as you are given.
    * If the answer is inaccurate, disputed, or unsupported, then you should output your revised answer text.
  In any case YOU MUST output only your answer.
